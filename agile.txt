Reflect back on your life. How many times has something that you’ve worked on been:

more complicated than you expected
less complicated than you expected
exactly as complicated as you expected
Do you have a tendency to underestimate, overestimate, or are you spot-on most of the time?

I have a tendency to do both. Sometimes I’m lucky enough to be spot-on.
But I believe that at times it might be best to overestimate to better prepare yourself for the situation.
Simply its best to over prepared than to be unprepared.
